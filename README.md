# Tunnul
 - Building a Minecraft server for fun!
 - It only uses the standard library!

### Features!
 - **You can join!**
 - **rotate freely!**
 - **Watch a sunrise!**
 - **Have your name Printed to the console!**
 - **The Compiler only gives you 27 warnings when you build it!**

### Milestones
 - Tunnul is able to communicate with Minecraft!
 - You can join the server!
 - Packets Can now be sent using only the Send! macro, with implicit type conversion!
 - All types except VarLong can be taken using packet.get_NAME() for dynamically sized, or packet.get::T() for static sizes (You have to use parrameter (arrow) operators around T, but github is interpreting it as a tag)

### Latest Comment
 - Restructured, reducing lines of code from 650 to 350, while adding functionality (only actual code, counted using "cloc")
